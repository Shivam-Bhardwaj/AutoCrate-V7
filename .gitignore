# Add other specific NX file extensions if you use them and want them ignored.

# You might want to keep specific template folders UNignored if needed
# For example, if you have 'nx_templates/*.prt' that you DO want to commit:
# !nx_templates/
# !nx_templates/*.prt 
# (But based on your request, you want all NX files ignored, so the above lines would be commented out or omitted)
