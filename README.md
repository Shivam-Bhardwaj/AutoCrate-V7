## Project Goal
To develop an automation system directly within Siemens NX that parametrically generates 3D models and complete assembly structures for industrial shipping crates. This system will be driven by design parameters and component lists calculated by an external Python-based "AutoCrate Wizard." The initial target is a functional proof-of-concept within a 7-hour development sprint.

## Key Features (Targeted for Initial Version)
* Parametric generation of crate base assemblies (skids, floorboards).
* Parametric generation of wall panels (sheathing and framing cleats for front, back, and sides).
* Parametric generation of the top panel/cap (sheathing and framing cleats).
* Assembly of all generated components into a final crate structure.
* Data input via CSV files detailing component dimensions, quantities, and positions.

## Technology Stack
* **CAD System:** Siemens NX
* **Automation API:** NXOpen Python
* **Input Data Calculation:** External Python application (Streamlit-based wizard)
* **Data Exchange Format:** CSV files

## Input Data
The system utilizes CSV files generated by the external "AutoCrate Wizard." These files contain:
* Detailed component lists (Bill of Materials).
* Dimensions (length, width, height) for each part.
* Positional data (X, Y, Z coordinates) for placing components within assemblies.

## Current Status
Initial development phase: Building core parametric templates and NXOpen scripts for basic crate structure generation.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
* Siemens NX (version to be specified, e.g., NX1980 or newer)
* Python environment capable of running the external "AutoCrate Wizard" to generate input CSVs.
* (Optional) VS Code or other Python-friendly editor for NXOpen script development.

### Setup
1.  Clone this repository.
2.  Ensure input CSV files (e.g., `skids.csv`, `panels.csv`) are available from the AutoCrate Wizard.
3.  Configure NXOpen script paths if necessary.

## Usage
(Details to be added as the system is developed - will likely involve running an NXOpen Python script from within Siemens NX, which will then prompt for or read pre-defined input CSV files.)

## Future Enhancements (Potential)
* Placement of decals and standard fasteners (e.g., Klimps).
* Generation of 2D drawings from the 3D model.
* More sophisticated error handling and user feedback.
* Direct integration with the Python AutoCrate Wizard (if feasible beyond CSV exchange).

## Contributing
(Details to be added if the project becomes open to contributions. For now, this is a solo development effort.)
